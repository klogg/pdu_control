lxml>=4.6     # Dependency for intellinet_pdu_api

# The intellinet_pdu_api library itself is not on PyPI.
# You need to ensure the 'intellinet_pdu_api' directory from the GitHub repo
# (https://github.com/01programs/Intellinet_163682_IP_smart_PDU_API)
# is accessible in your Python environment (e.g., place it alongside board.py
# or install it manually if it had a setup.py).
# Alternatively, if using pip with Git:
# git+https://github.com/01programs/Intellinet_163682_IP_smart_PDU_API.git#egg=intellinet_pdu_api&subdirectory=intellinet_pdu_api
